Please see the unified [beacon-v2](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2) repository for ongoing Beacon development.

## beacon-v2-Models

Models that leverage the Beacon Framework v2

### Introduction
The GA4GH Beacon specification is composed by two parts:

* the Beacon Framework
* the Beacon Models

**Beacon Models** (in *this* repo) describes the set of concepts included in a Beacon version (e.g. Beacon v2), like *individual* or *biosample*, and also the relationships between them. It could also be referred in this document as simply the *Model*.

Additional information is now accessible through the [Beacon v2 Documentation](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/models/).

**NOTE**: This is the project for Beacon v2 models development. The final Beacon v2 Framework
and Models will be made availble through the unified [`beacon-v2`](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2) repository.
